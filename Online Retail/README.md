**TASK BREAKDOWN**
The idea of the RFM analysis of this dataset was brought about by the quest for perfection in data analysis with constant study and practice. This dataset was sourced from dataworld and is made up of few columns and 541909 row.

TOOLS

The exploration and visualization of this data set gave head way to the practice data analysis tool-Python

Python was used for Data cleaning, Data Transformation and manipulation as well as statistical, RFM analysis and Visualization.

**AIM**

This project aims to leverages RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value) customer segmentation to enable business decision making. The basic objectives of this analysis are;

1. To perform data extraction, cleaning, and transformation of retail transactional data for RFM model development.

**ABOUT DATASET**
Online Retail sales dataset is a collection of data that contains information about the sales of online products or services in the retail industry.

This dataset contains historical sales data from a store, along with information about invoiceno, stockcode, description, quantity, invoicedate, unitprice, customer id and country.

**Recency**
The more recently a customer has made a purchase with a company, the more likely they will continue to keep the business and brand in mind for subsequent purchases. Compared with customers who have not bought from the business in months or even longer periods, the likelihood of engaging in future transactions with recent customers is arguably higher.

**Frequency**
The frequency of a customer’s transactions may be affected by factors such as the type of product, the price point for the purchase, and the need for replenishment or replacement. If the purchase cycle can be predicted — for example, when a customer needs to buy more groceries — marketing efforts may be directed toward reminding them to visit the business when staple items run low.

**Monetary Value**
Monetary value stems from how much the customer spends. A natural inclination is to put more emphasis on encouraging customers who spend the most money to continue to do so
