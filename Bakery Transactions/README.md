Excited to share my first Python data cleaning and exploration project! Delved into Bakery transaction datasets, unearthed intriguing patterns, and answered key questions such as;

1. Top 5 Best-selling and Bottom 5 Items across both years
2. Best-selling Items during weekends and weekdays
3. Time of day with most transaction

My recommendations were as follows;

•The shift in popularity from pastry to cake between 2016 and 2017 suggests changing consumer preferences. Analyzing factors influencing this shift, such as marketing strategies or product innovations, could provide valuable insights for product development or targeted promotions; The consistently low sales for items like Beacon, Chicken, Polenta, and The Bat across 2016 and 2017 may suggest these items are not popular or have limited demand. However, the slight sales for Gift Voucher in both years could indicate occasional interest.

•The higher sales of coffee, bread, tea items, cake, and pastries on weekdays may indicate a strong correlation with weekday routines. Understanding the specific times of these sales could guide marketing efforts, promotions, and inventory management to align with customer behavior during the weekdays.
The transaction pattern indicates a peak in the afternoon, particularly between 10 o'clock and 1 o'clock. This suggests that customers prefer purchasing these products during mid-morning and early afternoon hours. Adjusting marketing strategies and promotions to target this time frame could potentially maximize sales. Additionally, recognizing the lower sales at night might guide decisions related to staffing, inventory management. The shift in sales transaction from pastry being higher in the morning to tea and cake being more popular in the afternoon suggests a potential variation in consumer preferences during different times of the day.

Understanding these patterns allows for more targeted and effective business decisions.
